Absolute garbage. Hands down, the worst phone I've ever used. So busy focusing on trying to act like an Apple product that they've lost the plot for user experience. I'll be going back to Nokia. Had a Nokia phone for five years and never had the issues that sprung up within a week of using a Samsung.
Loyal Samsung owner. Purchased an S25 Edge directly from Samsung. USB-C didn't recognize charger. Was going to exchange but started working. 3 months later stopped working. Repair center can't get the parts. Samsung won't send them the part. Called 4 times. Battery performance worse using wirless charging now. As a business owner, am forced to send it in and be without my phone for AT LEAST 5-7 days. Unacceptable. Last Samsung I'm purchasing.
I bought the Galaxy A15 serial # R5CX3479KCH on 03/06/22 from Tello Mobile, order #**. I registered the phone on the Samsung account. It went out of service in mid May with a "no sim card" error message. Thinking that the sim card had fallen into the phone, I ordered a new sim card on 05/21/25, received and installed it on 05/28/25. The phone still had no service with the same error message, but is under warranty. Per Samsung procedures, I first took it to "ubreakifix" who examined the phone and verbally reported that the problem was the card reader, and it was irreparable. Per Samsung procedures, I returned the A15 on 05/30/25 with this background information and told them I was requesting a refund because it is under warranty, and I did not need the phone repaired or returned as I had purchased a new Galaxy A16. I asked them to honor their warranty on the A15.
When I phoned to follow up the first time, I was told that they didn't have any work order or the A15 phone and I should send it. Second follow up, they told me to send back the A15. Third follow up, they had found the work ticket dated 5/30 but it was for the A16 because they had taken it upon themselves to cancel the ticket for the A15 and changed it to apply to the A16. And I should send in the phone. (A15 with no ticket? A16 with no problems?) At that point, I filed a Complaint to the Better Business Bureau. The next day I received a call from the President's staff saying that the phone would soon be repaired and returned.
I responded that I need a refund because of the warranty, and sent copies of the purchase receipt for each phone. Their final reply emailed July 2nd: "I know you wanted a refund but upon review, your Samsung device has been repaired and it will be delivered to you on 07/03/2025 by 5:00 pm as per UPS **. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Their final stand is that I was supposed to wait for 32 days with no a phone because of their incompetence. I must swallow the cost of both phones so that would not have to spend a penny.
I WILL NEVER TRUST SAMSUNG EVER AGAIN! Your company made and sold me a product that out of the blue died from a fried motherboard. I was sent by your people to a certified Samsung technician who discovered the issue and after circling back to Samsung I am being bullied by your company to pay hundreds of dollars left to pay off the phone, a balance which should be canceled because I shouldn't be liable to pay for a phone that was made to fail before I even signed a contract which promised me an above average made phone which I'm realizing has an extensive amount of complaints, specifically S22's and S23's, both of which in recorded convo with an AT&T rep was revealed to me to be well known to have Firmware problems among other issues including Fried Motherboards.
I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years, consistently investing in their flagship devices. That loyalty ended with the Z Flip 6. Without warning, and absent any drop, water damage, or software update, my touchscreen became completely unresponsive—working one moment, completely dead the next. I treated the phone meticulously, and it was still well within the one-year warranty. When I brought it to a Samsung service center, I was stunned at the response: they claimed a minor cosmetic scratch—on the exterior and not on the screen—was enough to void the warranty entirely. Not damage, not abuse. A scratch.
I was excited to get my new Samsung A16 a few months ago. That lasted for about 2 weeks until all hell broke lose. Can't stop auto correct from capitalizing and making text nonsense as if not knowing English. Extreme lag on Google Maps that it sent me to different places a few times. I can't see any pictures sent through text or even through email on the phone. (Can't see pics sent from customers or my son's vacation in Asia.) Constantly removing itself from Bluetooth and going into plane-mode on its own. Will stop charging at 50% even when on charger all night. Happens 2-3 times a week. If I have it in my pocket upside down, the headphones get static or audio cuts out. That's just what I can think of off of the top of my head. It's an Android and seems that they are falling way behind iPhone if the new ones work like mines.
Samsung sent a corrupted "update" to my phone and it is WRECKED! Locked up and no way to unlock it. I'm a Doctor and my contacts are VERY IMPORTANT. Most data, all texts, contacts, etc are GONE! Samsung "Customer service" is a POS! They admitted it was THEIR FAULT! But won't do ANYTHING at ALL to help. I requested a mailer to send the phone to Samsung for their "pros" to fix my phone and hopefully to send my data to me. The ** REFUSED! Insisting that I PAY FOR SERVICE for SAMSUNG destroying MY PHONE! Here is a greedy, callous, stupid corporation that cares NOTHING for its customers! Don't be a victim! Don't buy ANY POS SAMSUNG PHONES OR PRODUCTS! BUYER BEWARE!
Ok, so. I'm prefacing this by saying my Samsung phone itself isn't the issue. My issue is with the spam notifications that you cannot stop about apps that nobody cares about. If someone wanted these apps, everybody is grown enough to search or an app with the functionality they desire. I know I'm not the only one that is disk and tired of the nonsense, given the Galaxy app has a 1 star rating, mainly revolving around this very issue.
My old S8 was starting to give me trouble and I was afraid it would die on me so I decided it was time to replace it. One thing about phones....I always have an issue with carrying them around. Either they are too big for my pocket or too big to fit easily in my purse so I decided that I wanted the Filp. It's a really nice little phone. I love the folding option...Whenever I go out, it slips easily anywhere. And since I have the Galaxy watch, it works with that seamlessly, even better than my S8. The battery life is a lot better than my S8, too. I like the little screen on the front where I can check the weather, calendar, my steps, and play music.
This phone is great. It is 5G compatible. It comes with an S Pen. Has long-lasting battery life. Has lasted me a year and a half so far and still working fine. Comes with lots of apps and one specifically for the S pen. Comes with YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Google Photos, Galaxy store, Google Maps, Netflix, Google Drive, Play Music and more. Very easy to set up. Dropped in many times and it still works fine and no screen damage. Very fast charging too. Comes with charger. Bought it brand new. Great camera quality. Has a front and back camera. Great phone overall.
The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is the best phone I've ever had. It's perfect in every way. Multi screen, battery life, built in memory, SD card, stylus, the multi stages of power saver. Max, medium, and standard, photos and videos and easy to crop and combine photos. Love how I can charge my wireless watch or headphones. The many themes to fit your personality.
I have had my Samsung Galaxy S-4 for several years, and I have been very happy with it. I have had no problems. It has always done the job that it was purchased for. I would get another Samsung phone for my next one.
This phone is designed to be a useful tool to help with someone who relies on multiple apps focusing on productivity as well as entertainment. Keeping track of financing, business, school assignment, work and social media has been so much better with this company than with previous companies I have had in the past.
This phone does internet, online games and even videos and movies. The only real problem is that my internet connection is unreliable, and it gets really slow when I'm only using the data. I mostly use it for text messages, phone calls and the Facebook messenger.
This is my 4th Samsung series phone - currently Note 20 Ultra 5g. I do like almost everything about the phone but there are a couple of things that I really wish they would address. First, I really wish they would go back to replaceable batteries. I picked up my last phone (a Note 10) when my Note 8 Active just up and stopped. I was told later the problem was probably caused by a shorted out battery. The other really small item is the lengths you have to go to get the device to acknowledge a home based cloud controller drive. Going through the internet with cloud controller app is okay, but shouldn't have to use internet when device is on intranet.
I prefer Samsung phones as they are user friendly, work great. Not too heavy, have lots of memory, wide display, etc. I always look to get another Samsung when trading up. The camera takes great pictures.
I have been using Samsung phones for over a decade now and I am very pleased, overall, although there is always room for improvement (hence the 4 stars). I love the different functions available on the Samsung phones and of course, the camera is a huge BONUS!
My phone is an older model and fairly easy to use. Tried an upgrade and found it too complicated. Satisfied with the one I own. Just needed a new battery. I really don't need a more advanced model.The sheer **customization available on Android** is a massive advantage. I can change my launcher, icon packs, and widgets to completely personalize my phone’s look and function.
The **bloatware pre-installed by carriers and manufacturers** is infuriating. I don't want three different weather apps and can't even delete most of them without rooting the device.
The **battery life on my Samsung Galaxy S Ultra** is insane. I routinely get a full two days of heavy use before I even think about needing a charger.
The **update schedule for most Android phones is terrible**. Flagships might get two years, but budget phones are often abandoned, leaving them with security vulnerabilities.
I love the **open nature of the file system**. I can easily transfer files between my PC and phone, and download any type of file without restrictions.
The **in-screen fingerprint readers are hit-or-miss**. They work great in perfect conditions, but forget about it if my finger is slightly wet or dirty.
The **huge variety of hardware is excellent**. You can find a perfect phone at any price point—from $150 budget models to $1,800 foldables.
The **camera consistency is poor across the ecosystem**. Even top-tier phones from different brands process the same scene wildly differently, making photo comparisons frustrating.
The **fast charging speeds on my OnePlus phone are revolutionary**. I can go from 10% to 100% in under 30 minutes, which completely changes how I manage my battery.
The **quality control on budget Android tablets is awful**. They slow down drastically after a few months, and the screens often have poor resolution and terrible viewing angles.
**Google Assistant is genuinely smarter than any other voice assistant**. It handles complex, contextual questions about my schedule or local information perfectly.
I hate how many apps I download are clearly just **poorly optimized ports from iOS**. They look clunky, have inconsistent interfaces, and often crash more frequently.
The **flexibility of split-screen and floating windows** on my tablet is fantastic for true multitasking. It makes working on two documents at once simple and fluid.
The **resale value of Android phones is abysmal**. A year after purchasing a flagship, I can only get a fraction of what I paid for it when trying to upgrade.
The **ability to use any USB-C accessory** (drives, monitors, audio interfaces) without needing a proprietary dongle makes my phone a true portable computer.
The **default messaging experience is fractured**. Switching between SMS, RCS, and different carrier apps makes group chats complicated and unreliable.
My **Wear OS watch has great fitness features** and a fantastic bright screen. It tracks my runs accurately and has a huge selection of third-party apps.
The **operating system can feel fragmented**. Different manufacturers put completely different "skins" over Android, making the user experience inconsistent when switching brands.
**Side-loading apps is a huge pro**. I can install apps not available on the Play Store, giving me total control over the software on my own device.
The **NFC/tap-to-pay feature often bugs out** on my Samsung phone. I have to try multiple times at the register for it to register the payment, which is embarrassing.
The **Google Pixel camera's computational photography is simply magic**. It captures perfect, natural-looking photos in low light without me having to fiddle with any Pro settings.
I love the **"Now Brief" feature on my Galaxy**; it collects all my at-a-glance information, like weather and upcoming events, into one perfectly organized page.
The **open-source nature of the Android kernel** lets advanced users install custom ROMs like GrapheneOS, offering unmatched privacy and security control.
The **"Circle to Search" feature is outstandingly useful**. Being able to instantly search for anything on my screen by simply drawing a circle around it saves so much time.
The **Foldable screen technology is genuinely innovative**. Unfolding my phone into a mini-tablet provides a huge productivity boost that no slab phone can match.
**Android's built-in spam and call filtering is a lifesaver**. I rarely get scam calls because Google automatically detects and silences them before my phone even rings.
I can **use a microSD card** to expand my phone's storage cheaply and easily. This is a massive cost saving over paying for expensive internal storage upgrades.
The **"Material You" design language** is wonderful. My phone's entire interface, from the icons to the widgets, automatically color-coordinates with my wallpaper.
The **desktop experience offered by Samsung DeX** is a game-changer. I can plug my phone into a monitor and use it as a full desktop PC for lightweight work.
The **accessibility features, like the "Universal Gestures" on my Galaxy Watch**, are incredibly nimble and beneficial for hands-free control.
I appreciate that **Android allows me to set default apps**. I can choose my preferred browser, dialer, and messenger, giving me real choice over my experience.
The **OnePlus super-fast wireless charging** is fantastic. My phone is back to 80% power on its charging pad before I'm even done making breakfast.
The **ability to cast content to any brand of smart TV** (Samsung, LG, Sony) using the built-in Cast feature is a huge plus for media sharing.
The **flagship phones are now getting seven years of software support** from both Google and Samsung, finally addressing the biggest historical drawback of Android.
The **Pixel's on-device AI features** run locally without needing the cloud, making common tasks faster and ensuring my personal data stays private on the device.The **Google Pixel's astrophotography mode** is genuinely mind-blowing. It captures detailed photos of the night sky that look professional, right from a standard phone camera.
The **Samsung Galaxy Watch's body composition analysis** is a gimmicky feature. The readings are inconsistent and vary wildly depending on how I grip the watch, making it useless for accurate tracking.
The **massive, vibrant OLED displays** on modern Android flagships (especially Samsung) are unmatched for media consumption. The colors pop and the brightness is incredible outdoors.
The **lack of a consistent user experience** is Android's biggest weakness. Switching from a Samsung phone to a Pixel tablet means relearning basic navigation and setting menus.
I appreciate that **Nokia and Motorola offer excellent, durable budget phones** that serve as reliable secondary or work devices without costing an arm and a leg.
The **camera shutter lag is a persistent issue** on many lower-end Android phones. You miss the perfect shot because of the delay between pressing the button and the photo being taken.
The **flexibility to use any cloud service** (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive) seamlessly for backups and file storage is a huge pro, unlike systems that try to lock you into one service.
The **pre-installed antivirus/security software** on some manufacturer phones is aggressive and generates constant, annoying pop-up notifications that slow the system down.
The **Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's clamshell design** is fantastic. It folds up small enough to actually fit in my tiny pockets, making it the most portable flagship phone ever.
The **quality of Bluetooth audio codecs is inconsistent** across the Android ecosystem. Getting a high-fidelity connection with my premium headphones is often a painful setup process.
The **Pixel's call screening feature is brilliant**. It handles known spam calls silently and lets me screen unknown calls with a transcription before I decide to answer.
The **proprietary app stores** (like Samsung's Galaxy Store) are completely unnecessary and just fragment the app experience, forcing me to check multiple places for updates.
The **One UI interface from Samsung is incredibly feature-rich**. I can tweak every setting imaginable, including granular volume controls for different app categories.
The **Tensor chip can run hot** when I'm playing demanding games or recording 4K video for an extended period, leading to thermal throttling and noticeable slowdowns.
I love that I can **use third-party accessories like non-proprietary chargers** and cables without worrying about compatibility issues or receiving error messages.
The **wide array of third-party launchers** often causes battery drain or strange system bugs, forcing me to stick with the manufacturer's default launcher for stability.
The **multi-user support on Android tablets** is great for families. My kids each have their own login and apps, keeping my work profile secure and separate.
**Motorola's "shake-to-turn-on-flashlight" gesture** is a small but brilliant piece of intuitive design that I wish every single phone manufacturer would adopt.The **Motorola Edge's clean, near-stock Android software** experience is a breath of fresh air. It’s fast, free of clutter, and gets features before heavy custom skins.
The **bloatware that comes with some cheap carriers' phones** is a security nightmare. It often asks for excessive permissions and can't be uninstalled without significant effort.
The **Samsung Galaxy Fold's large, tablet-sized inner screen** is perfect for reading comics, editing spreadsheets, and watching movies during my commute. It’s genuinely two devices in one.
The **inconsistency in camera performance** between the main, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses on many mid-range Android phones is distracting. The colors and white balance rarely match.
I love the **advanced notification management in Android**. I can snooze notifications, get reply options right in the shade, and organize my alerts by conversation priority.
The **Google Play Store is plagued with low-quality, ad-ridden applications**. It's difficult to find a trustworthy, professional-grade app without wading through a sea of junk.
The **ability to root and flash custom firmware (ROMs)** gives me complete control over my device, allowing for performance tweaks, personalized features, and extended security updates.
The **hardware design of the Google Pixel is unique and appealing**. The distinct camera bar and fun, often two-tone, color schemes make it stand out from the generic slab phones.
The **Wear OS integration with Google Fit** provides comprehensive health data that is easy to understand, helping me track my daily activity, sleep, and fitness goals effectively.
The **default music player apps are often abandoned** or feature-poor. I immediately have to download a third-party player just to get basic features like folder organization.
The **flexibility of using widgets** to instantly view my calendar, to-do lists, and weather forecasts directly on my home screen is incredibly efficient.
The **build materials on budget Android phones often feel cheap and plasticky**. They scratch easily and lack the premium, durable feel of their flagship competitors.
**RCS messaging with "Chat Features"** is finally replacing SMS and offers read receipts, high-quality media, and typing indicators, making texting with other Android users much better.
The **lack of a unified facial recognition standard** means my phone's 'Face Unlock' is often not secure enough for banking apps or payments, forcing me to rely on the slower PIN.
I appreciate that **Android allows me to set granular permissions** for every app. I can deny camera or location access while still allowing the app to function in other ways.
The **customizability of the keyboard (Gboard, SwiftKey)** is excellent. I can easily change the layout, theme, and even add a clipboard manager for efficiency.
The **fastest, most powerful processors** are almost always available on Android devices first, giving users the cutting edge in mobile computing performance months before competitors.The **Motorola Edge's clean, near-stock Android software** experience is a breath of fresh air. It’s fast, free of clutter, and gets features before heavy custom skins.

The **fastest, most powerful processors** are almost always available on Android devices first, giving users the cutting edge in mobile computing performance months before competitors.
The **OnePlus Watch 3's battery life is phenomenal**—I get a solid 4-5 days of use, which is a massive relief compared to the daily charging routine of other smartwatches.
The **camera on my Samsung Galaxy is too aggressively post-processed**. It oversaturates colors and over-sharpens details, making photos look artificial rather than realistic.
**Android's notification auto-grouping** is fantastic for minimizing clutter; it stops apps from overwhelming me with dozens of individual, tiny alerts.
I can't believe **I still see ads in the stock Samsung Health and Weather apps** on a premium-priced phone. It feels invasive and completely unacceptable for a flagship device.
The **Pixel's Live Translate feature** is a game-changer when traveling abroad. It instantly translates conversations, making communication with locals stress-free.
The **huge screen sizes of premium phones** make one-handed use almost impossible. It forces an uncomfortable hand gymnastics just to reach the top corner of the display.
The **Motorola's "Chop-Chop" gesture** to turn on the flashlight is so intuitive and quick—a perfect example of simple, smart hardware integration.
The **Wear OS update process is incredibly messy and complex** across different device manufacturers and carriers. It takes forever for new versions to roll out to all users.
**Google's Material You color-theming system** makes the phone feel truly personal; the whole UI adapting to my wallpaper is a delightful visual touch.
The **device fragmentation makes buying accessories a headache**. I have to research every case, screen protector, and charger specifically for my exact model, which is frustrating.
The **option for removable storage (MicroSD)** is a massive advantage for media creators. I can offload massive video files quickly without relying on cloud uploads or cables.
The **GPS tracking on some Wear OS watches is terrible for outdoor workouts**. It often cuts out or misreads the route, leading to inaccurate distance and pace metrics.The **Samsung Galaxy S Ultra's S Pen** is far more useful than I expected. It’s excellent for quick note-taking during meetings, and the remote camera shutter is perfect for group photos.
The **Samsung Knox security platform** is top-tier. I feel confident that my professional and personal data are segmented and protected by military-grade security features.
The **Xiaomi phone's custom operating system (MIUI) is overloaded with features** and feels clunky and unintuitive. It tries to do too much and ends up confusing the user.
I love the **huge, vibrant screens on Android phones**; they are typically brighter and offer higher refresh rates than competitors, making scrolling and gaming silky smooth.
The **Google Pixel's software support commitment** of seven years is phenomenal. It finally makes an Android phone feel like a long-term investment rather than a disposable gadget.
The **pre-installed advertising in certain international Android versions** is unacceptable. I paid for a premium phone and shouldn't have to see ads in the stock apps.
The **Garmin and Fitbit watches that run specialized OSs** offer significantly **better battery life** than full Wear OS watches, lasting 5+ days on a single charge.
The **quality of Bluetooth streaming can be very inconsistent**. One day my earbuds sound great, the next day they are crackling, and I have to reboot my phone to fix it.
The **flexibility to download high-resolution music files** and manage them directly on the device is a huge advantage for audiophiles who refuse to rely solely on streaming.
The **Google Play Store's refund process is difficult and slow**. Getting money back for an app that didn't work as advertised takes days of fighting with customer service.
The **design of the Google Pixel watches** is the sleekest in the Android wearable market. The smooth, curved glass and simple interface make it feel like jewelry, not just tech.
The **lack of simple, reliable accessories** for many niche Android phones is annoying. Finding a good quality, unique case often means ordering a generic one online.
The **OnePlus super-fast wired charging is a lifesaver**—a 15-minute charge is enough to get me through an emergency afternoon, completely eliminating battery anxiety.
The **camera on my mid-range phone only performs well in perfect daylight**. Any attempt to take a photo indoors or at night results in a grainy, blurry mess.
**Android's ability to mirror the entire screen to any smart TV or casting device** is excellent for instantly sharing photos and videos with the entire room.
The **fragmentation of operating system versions** still forces app developers to neglect older phones, meaning I lose access to useful app features faster than I should.
