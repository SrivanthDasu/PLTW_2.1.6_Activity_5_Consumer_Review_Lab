I would give no stars if I could. My 16 phone is still under warranty but Apple refusing to replace my battery. My phone on the back gets VERY hot. Apple store made me turn my phone off in case it caught on fire. Asurion said the 16 battery has placement changes and does not allow them to have or replace batteries. They were stunned Apple wouldn’t recognize my warranty. But Apple store was worried enough about the battery catching fire!! Interesting 16 was a complete battery placement change from all the other previous models. So I have a new 16 phone, worried about the ion battery catching fire and it loses a charge faster since I updated to the recent update! Apple must be losing money if they can't replace a battery under warranty! Other owners complaining about the same after updating! Our family has only owned Apple products.
The iPhone 6 is a fine model with rich features and ease of use. I am not sure why Apple needs to release so many models and variations. While I understand the profit motive I am not sure if the consumer is really what the company worries about. Take some of their later models like 7 and 7S, with more pixel cameras, etc., it seems their engineers are making the products for themselves. Truly, how many consumers really even care for those features?
The keys on the phone can easily be used and the fonts on the phone screen can be made where I can see them and type them. Some phone keys are so small that I can barely see them let alone type them.
I bought the iPhone 16 about three months ago for over $2,000, and I’ve been very disappointed with the Wi-Fi performance. The phone constantly drops connections, shows “No Internet Connection,” and struggles to stay connected even when other devices on the same network work fine. I’ve tried all the suggested fixes — resets, software updates, different routers — and nothing has solved the problem. I even went to Apple for support, but the issue is still unresolved. My iPhone is under warranty until 2027, and I expect Apple to either fix the problem or provide a proper replacement. At this price point, a basic feature like Wi-Fi should work reliably. I’m posting this review so other customers are aware and so Apple understands how serious this issue is.
I had to get a replacement iPhone 14 through Verizon and I have lost 2 years worth of data. I will never own another iPhone or recommend one to anyone. I blame iCloud for their poor performance and I will have to spend days just manually loading contacts.
Overall, the phone is great. The software, however, needs work. This is specific to the autocorrect feature. It has stopped only changing the word you are working on and had started grabbing entire chunks of text and randomly changing them. The results are overt errors added to everything from texts to twitter. It’s particularly bad with prepositions and tense. Ex. ‘I jumped hammer’ becomes ‘I jumps over the hammer’. ‘If I went to the store’ becomes ‘Of I want to the store.’
This phone is very dependable and easy to use. Once I finally switched to an iPhone I’ve never used anything else if I could help it. I’ve tried to encourage others to use the iPhone for their personal devices and have gotten mixed responses. However I love the iPhone. Even a novice user can learn how to use it easily.
Apps are terrible by comparison. No alarm clock that lets you set a future date. You can’t even use the alarm clock unless you hand over your health information and open a health app account. No calculator that provides a running calculation you can check or backspace. Difficult to toggle between screens. Most apps require annual subscription that were free on Android. Charging delays itself for “optimization“. You can’t get any help without also buying a membership that is very expensive. The camera quality is excellent and you can silence without logging in. Face login only works occasionally and phone logs off all the time. I cry daily over regrets in getting iPhone but too late to go back to android due to my contract. Advice to others - don’t do it! Losses exceed the nicer pictures.
Android to iPhone in August 2022. You would think by now Apple would provide a standard keyboard option. Typing passwords would be easier without having to change screens for numbers/punctuation/symbols. Too much emphasis on cameras and emojis and such. Ridiculous!!!! Not likely I’ll be purchasing anything Apple again. EVER!
I charge my phone all night. The following day after 2 hrs of used battery drained 1/4 of full. By 12:00 noon the phone is 1/2 full. By 2 o’clock must be charge again. I called Apple support, they run a test battery, they found an issue but never suggested to do anything, only to update the latest update. At this time I have a lemon I phone, no one to help us because we like their product..
I just purchased iPhone 14 pro max a week ago. I just noticed that its video camera is flickering. I return it and purchase new iPhone 14 pro max. Again, its video camera quality is same. It is frustrating. While comparing video camera of iPhone 14 pro max with iPhone 11 pro max, iPhone 14 pro max is worst. Apple is just rush to lunch new iPhones instead of making it reliable. Please invest your energy to make your iPhones reliable instead of just adding the number in front of it. I am again planning to return it and go back to my old phone. Please double check video camera of iPhone 14 pro max before purchasing it.
Paid $1730.92 but never receive anything. But they said it's none of their business because it is marked delivered by UPS. I ordered an iPhone 14 pro max 1tb to be delivered to my house. The UPS driver stole my stuff, delivered an empty box. But Apple does not protect their consumer. They could have track the lost phone or something or do more investigation. But instead, they stated that UPS claimed that they delivered and that's it. I lost my money but it's none of their business. Apple is doing business with criminals who steal from their customer. Horrible online shopping experience. Why selling stuff online when you cannot protect your customer from thief?
I recently got the new iPhone 14 Pro Max. I did the transfer from my old phone to my new phone over wifi like I usually do. However, a bunch of my shared albums were missing. It is just a stroke of luck that I hadn't erased the old phone yet, which I normally do, otherwise all of them would be gone (around 2,000 photos and videos). I have had 3 customer service phone calls about it so far and it STILL hasn't been fixed. So I am stuck waiting to delete the phone and give it to my mom, who really needs a new phone. Not to mention 5 hours of my time have been wasted thus far. I have never had such a frustrating, disappointing, and stressful experience. I hope they give me a gift card or something for the wasted time, since I can't get my time back and this should have never happened.
I bought a iPhone for my daughter. She has a learning disability. She locked herself out of her phone and didn't know the password due to her learning disability. Although I have every receipt and record showing that I was the original owner of the phone: Apple refuses to unlock the phone. I have sent multiple attempts to get them to unlock and they deny every request. Now my daughter's phone is useless and cannot be used. Apple doesn't care: and when I called the manager got very rude and aggressive with me and told me to call the police with my problem. Apple locked the phone not the Police. They treated me like a criminal. I never had a experience where a company was completely unwilling to provide any kind of resolution to a problem that completely locked me out from using a product I have rightfully paid for.
Called to setup a new phone when my old phone's screen randomly stopped working. Impossible to get into your account without a second expensive Apple device, or resetting your account "which could take weeks". Completely unacceptable that I hung up with them with zero resolution. They don't give **.
Volume for GPS cannot be increased. I have wasted over an hour searching for a solution. Which duck wad at Apple decided to make the volume, for the GPS when Bluetooth connected to the car, so difficult? Or impossible to increase?
iPhones offer a seamless user experience with their intuitive iOS interface and powerful processors, ensuring smooth performance. The devices boast top-notch cameras that capture stunning photos and videos.
This phone is very dependable and easy to use. Once I finally switched to an iPhone I’ve never used anything else if I could help it.

I found out after a lot of experience that MSI are the best and coolest Gaming accessories I have ever seen and I really recommend it because it is cheaper and more stronger and more cooler and fit a perfect gaming setup
I have had an IPhone starting with the IPhone launch in 2007. I have updated every 3-4 yrs and now have the IPhone 12 Pro Max. I love everything about the Apple products that I use almost continuously. I tried other OS' for interface with proprietary security systems, etc. and have found them vastly inferior to my Apple Products.The MacBook Pro M3 Max is an absolute powerhouse. It handles 8K video editing like a simple word document, and the fan literally never spins up. Incredible performance.
The exorbitant price of Apple's cables and dongles is infuriating. $30 for a basic charging brick is just corporate greed, especially when competitors include them for free.
The seamless integration between my iPhone, Watch, and AirPods is unmatched. I can switch a podcast from my phone to my Watch for a run without missing a beat. The ecosystem is the real product.
The forced reliance on the walled garden is frustrating. I should be able to sideload apps or use a third-party payment system easily without jumping through hoops.
The Apple Watch Ultra 2's new Action Button is surprisingly useful. I’ve mapped it to start my scuba dive logging immediately—great for specialized tasks.
The base model storage options on the iPhone are a joke. 128GB is not enough in 2025, forcing users to pay a massive premium for the 256GB model.
The M-series chip completely eliminated my need for an external GPU. The graphics performance on the MacBook Air is now more than enough for casual gaming and design work.
iCloud is confusing and unreliable for photo syncing. I constantly run into issues with storage space, and photos sometimes disappear or fail to upload properly.
The ceramic shield on the newer iPhones is a huge improvement. I’ve dropped my phone several times and haven't shattered the screen yet—a miracle!
I hate that the Apple Pencil still magnetically charges on the side of the iPad Pro, where it often gets knocked off. A simple, secure slot would be much better design.
The battery life on the 13-inch MacBook Air is legendary. I can work a full 10-hour day on battery power alone and still have juice left over for an evening movie.
The camera bump on the back of the latest iPhone Pro models is ridiculous. It makes the phone wobble horribly on a table, and it’s impossible to use without a thick case.
Apple Arcade is a hidden gem. It offers a fantastic selection of high-quality, ad-free games for one low monthly fee. Great for killing time without microtransactions.
Siri is utterly useless when I'm driving. It constantly misunderstands names or simple navigation commands. I end up pulling over to type things myself.
The ProMotion display on the iPad Pro makes drawing feel exactly like pen on paper. The responsiveness and low latency are a huge advantage for digital artists.
It’s unacceptable that a product as expensive as the Vision Pro requires multiple external batteries and has a bulky cable connecting them. It ruins the 'cordless' feel.
The build quality of the MacBooks is fantastic. The aluminum chassis is sturdy, the keyboard is excellent, and the hinge feels rock-solid even after years of use.
Apple Maps is still leagues behind Google Maps, especially for public transit and real-time traffic accuracy outside major metro areas. I always default back to Google.
AirPods Pro spatial audio completely immerses you in music. It's not just a gimmick; it genuinely makes certain albums feel like a live performance.
The company's continuous abandonment of older, perfectly good ports (like MagSafe 1 or the headphone jack) forces expensive adapter purchases and unnecessary e-waste.
The new low-light performance on the iPhone 16 Pro camera is stunning. Night mode photos look cleaner and more detailed than ever before. It's replaced my dedicated point-and-shoot camera.
Why does Apple force me to use their Safari browser? It consistently performs worse on specific work sites compared to Chrome, but the integration with macOS is so deep it's hard to avoid.
The Mac Mini M2 is the best desktop value in computing right now. Tons of power, tiny footprint, and a price that's actually reasonable for what you get.
The butterfly keyboard saga on MacBooks was a terrible PR mistake. It made me lose faith in the basic reliability of their hardware for years.
The Family Sharing feature for subscriptions and purchases saves my household a ton of money. It works seamlessly and makes managing accounts easy.
It feels like Apple releases a new 'must-have' accessory or feature that requires a different, expensive dongle every single year. It's accessory fatigue.
The Retina display on my M1 iMac is absolutely gorgeous for color-critical work. The color accuracy and brightness are top-tier for professional photography and design.
The charging situation for the Magic Mouse is still an embarrassment. Having the port on the bottom is a functional design failure that should have been fixed years ago.
I love the simplicity and security of Apple Pay. Using my watch to pay everywhere is fast, secure, and I rarely carry my physical wallet anymore.
The lack of user-repairability is criminal. Simple battery replacements or screen repairs cost a fortune, pushing people toward unnecessary full device upgrades.
The durability of the Apple Watch is incredible. I've accidentally smashed it into doorframes, and the screen is still flawless. It's truly a tough device.
The subscription creep is getting out of hand. Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Fitness+... it adds up quickly and feels like I'm paying too much for their ecosystem access.
Face ID is instant and incredibly reliable, even with minor changes in my appearance like a hat or different glasses. It's the most polished biometric security on the market.
My old MagSafe charger cable frayed and almost started a fire. For the price, their proprietary charging solutions should have vastly better stress relief and cable durability.The MacBook Air is the perfect everyday laptop. It’s light, fast, and completely silent. For 90% of users, this is the only Mac they'll ever need.
Why do the AirPods always die right when I need them most? The battery life seems to decay way faster than advertised, especially in cold weather.
The new **iPhone Pro display** is incredibly bright and clear outdoors. Direct sunlight is no longer an issue when trying to read texts or take a photo.
**Apple TV+'s content library is still too small.** Paying a separate subscription fee for only a handful of shows, no matter how high-quality, doesn't feel worth it.
The **M3 chip’s power efficiency** is remarkable. My Mac Studio uses less power than my previous PC while delivering significantly better performance on rendering tasks.
I despise the **lightning-to-USB-C changeover**. It forced me to buy new cables and adapters for all my older accessories. Just stick to one standard for a few years, please!
The **iPad mini is the best reading tablet** on the market. Its size is perfect for holding for hours, and the A-series chip keeps everything snappy.
I'm extremely disappointed with the **durability of the official Apple silicon cases**. They look great for a month, then start peeling and tearing at the corners.
The **haptic feedback on the iPhone** provides subtle, useful confirmation for every interaction. It's a small detail that makes the phone feel more premium and responsive.
The **default Mail app is terrible**. It constantly misses filtering spam and offers almost none of the advanced organization features I rely on in third-party clients.
**Stage Manager on the iPad** finally makes true windowed multitasking feel possible. It has genuinely increased my productivity when using the tablet as my main device.
The **prices of the professional monitors** (Studio Display/Pro Display XDR) are absolutely ridiculous. You can buy high-quality competition for half the cost.
I love that I can unlock my Mac using my **Apple Watch**. It's fast, secure, and I never have to type in a password after a fresh reboot.
The **repair cost for screen damage is prohibitive**. Paying nearly the price of a new phone for a simple repair is why I left Apple for a cheaper brand.
**Fitness+ is a great service**! The trainers are motivating, the workouts are high-quality, and seeing my Watch metrics on the screen makes it really engaging.
The **iPod shuffle was discontinued too soon**. It was the perfect simple, tiny music device for running without distractions. Bring back the simple gear!
The **Magic Keyboard typing experience** is stellar. It has the perfect balance of key travel and responsiveness, making long documents feel effortless.
The **AirTag battery is difficult to replace**. The tiny door and odd turning mechanism make me struggle every time the low battery notification pops up.
The **MacBook Pro speakers are the best on any laptop**. They have incredible depth and bass that makes listening to music a pleasure without external speakers.
I wish **Siri could integrate better with third-party apps**. It's still limited in what actions it can take, especially compared to Google Assistant or Alexa.
The **new Apple Pencil Hover feature** is excellent for precise editing and drawing. It completely changed how I use the iPad for graphic design.
The **notch on the iPhone** is an irritating eyesore. It breaks the symmetry of the screen and is a design flaw that Apple has held onto for too long.
The **seamless hand-off of phone calls** between my Mac and iPhone is fantastic. I never miss a work call even if I step away from my phone.
**Battery health degradation is too aggressive**. My iPhone drops below 80% capacity right around the two-year mark, creating a planned obsolescence feeling.The new **MacBook Pro display** with mini-LED is stunning. It has incredible contrast and deep blacks that make watching HDR content an experience that beats most desktop monitors.
The **charging speed on the iPhone** is painfully slow compared to modern Android phones. It takes way too long to get a full charge, which is inconvenient when I'm in a rush.
I genuinely love the **Apple Watch's health monitoring**. The ECG and crash detection features are incredible and provide serious peace of mind. It’s more than just a gadget; it's a safety tool.
**Apple Music’s classical app** is well-organized, but the main app's UI is cluttered and confusing. Finding new music or managing my library is a frustrating chore.
The **iPhone 15 Pro's move to USB-C** is fantastic for travel; now I only need one cable for my laptop, tablet, and phone. It's about time they made the switch.
I hate the **lack of standardization for the Apple Pencil**. The new iPads use the USB-C Pencil, which isn't compatible with my old Pro, forcing me to buy two separate ones.
The **MacBook Pro keyboard is back to its prime**. The keys have a satisfying click and deep travel. It’s durable and comfortable for hours of non-stop typing.
The **limited customization on iOS** is a major drawback. I feel locked into Apple's default layouts and widgets, and I can't truly make my home screen my own.
The **AirPods Pro noise cancellation** is indispensable on airplanes and noisy commutes. It creates a pocket of silence that lets me focus on work or relaxation.
The **Apple TV remote** is still a terrible design. It’s too small, symmetrical, and I constantly pick it up backwards in the dark. A simple backlight would fix everything.
I appreciate the **longevity of software support**. My old iPhone is still getting the latest iOS updates, which helps hold its resale value and keeps it secure for years.
The **default price of iCloud storage is too high**. I feel like I'm being penalized for owning a lot of Apple devices by having to pay a premium every month.
The **iMac's integrated speaker system** is surprisingly robust and cinematic. It fills my whole office with rich, detailed sound for music and video calls.
I find the **Face ID security too restrictive**. If my phone is sitting flat on my desk, I have to physically pick it up to unlock it, which breaks my workflow.
The **Continuity Camera feature** that turns my iPhone into a webcam for my Mac is brilliant. It gives me a professional-quality video feed for all my meetings without extra cost.
The **Apple Card interest rates are not competitive**. The cashback feature is nice, but I'd rather have a lower APR option from another bank.
The **iPad's split-screen feature** is great for referencing documents while writing. It's fluid and makes the large screen feel utilized for professional work.
The **official Apple leather accessories wear out too fast**. The watch band and iPhone wallet faded and peeled much sooner than they should have given their premium price.
The **Find My network's precision finding** is magical. The arrows guiding me directly to my lost AirPod case were super helpful and accurate to within an inch.
The **App Store review process is inconsistent and unfair**. Good apps get rejected for arbitrary reasons, while scammy apps sometimes sneak through.The **M-series performance in the Mac Mini** is overkill for general use, but I love the confidence that I'll never experience slowdowns, no matter how many apps I have open. It's a tiny beast.
The decision to remove the charging brick from the box, even for the expensive iPhone Pro models, is pure cost-cutting masked as an environmental initiative. It's a cynical move.
The **integration of the Apple Watch with my gym equipment** via GymKit is fantastic. It automatically syncs my workout data perfectly, eliminating manual logging.
I find the **new Mac Pro tower design** ugly and uninspired, especially considering the price. It looks like a cheese grater and lacks the clean aesthetic of previous generations.
**Live Text on the iPhone** is a feature I use daily. Being able to copy text from any image or photo is incredibly useful for capturing information quickly.
The **storage upgrade costs are extortionate**. Jumping from the base SSD to the next tier on a MacBook costs hundreds of dollars, which is far beyond the market rate for the components.
The **Find My network's battery life is impressive**. My AirTags last over a year on a single standard coin battery, making them very low-maintenance.
The **touch bar on the old MacBook Pros** was a terrible idea. It was prone to failure, often distracting, and I much prefer the tactile feel of physical function keys.
The **ProRes video recording on the iPhone** finally makes it a viable B-cam for professional video work. The quality and color depth are amazing for a phone camera.
**Apple's trade-in values are insultingly low**. They offer pennies for a perfectly good device that they will then refurbish and sell for a huge profit.
The **smoothness of the macOS trackpad** is unmatched. No Windows laptop comes close to the precision and gesture control of the Magic Trackpad or MacBook trackpads.
I am annoyed by the **lack of transparency regarding battery replacements**. It's hard to find a trustworthy, affordable third-party repair shop without voiding the warranty.
The **Apple TV 4K interface is the best for media consumption**. It’s clean, fast, and seamlessly handles switching between different streaming services without lag.
The **Dynamic Island is just a distraction**. It takes up space at the top of the screen and tries to turn a necessary camera cutout into a 'feature.' I wish I could turn it off.
The **ability to start a FaceTime call on my phone and seamlessly transfer it to my Mac** when I get home is incredibly convenient. The continuity features are world-class.
The **mandatory subscription model for features like iCloud+ and Fitness+** makes the total cost of ownership of the ecosystem extremely high over a period of years.
The **base model iPad Air is the sweet spot** in the tablet lineup. It balances performance, a great display, and a reasonable price perfectly for most consumers.
The **keyboard on the Magic Keyboard Folio for iPad is mushy**. It doesn't offer the same satisfying click or stability as the one on the MacBook Pro.
**SharePlay is brilliant** for watching movies or listening to music with friends remotely. It works so much better than trying to sync manually over other apps.
The **stock Weather app is beautiful but unreliable**. It often lags behind real-time weather changes and sometimes reports inaccurate local forecasts.
The **speed of macOS updates is impressive**. The downloads and installations are usually very quick and painless, minimizing downtime.
The **over-reliance on proprietary chargers** (MagSafe 2, Apple Watch puck, etc.) when the rest of the world is moving to open standards like USB-C is infuriating.
The **quality of the speakers in the new iPhone** is noticeably better—they are loud, clear, and have a surprising amount of bass for a smartphone.
**Buying accessories directly from Apple is a scam**. The third-party market offers the same quality cables, cases, and adapters for a fraction of the price.
I love the **consistency of the design language** across all products; it creates a clean, premium, and unified look across my entire desk setup.
The **Apple ID and two-factor authentication** process is overly complex and sometimes locks me out for no reason. It needs to be more user-friendly.
The **new low-power mode for the Apple Watch** is fantastic for multi-day hiking. It extends the battery life without losing essential tracking features.
The **price of the iPhone screen replacement** is genuinely shocking. It feels like they are penalizing customers for accidental damage.
**iMessage security and end-to-end encryption** give me complete confidence that my personal communications are private and secure from prying eyes.
The **built-in VPN service in iCloud Private Relay** is too slow and unreliable for streaming content. It causes more problems than it solves.
